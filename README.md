# Checkers
This is a simple version of the traditional checkers board game. 
It is designed for two-players to play against each other, and consists of all the traditional checker rules and pieces.
# Game
Each player has 12 pieces that fit inside each of the boxes on the board. The pieces are placed on every other dark square and then staggered by rows.

Each player takes their turn by moving a piece. Pieces are always moved diagonally and can be moved in the following ways:

Diagonally in the forward direction (towards the opponent) to the next dark square.
