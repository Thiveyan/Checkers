# Checkers
This is a simple version of the traditional checkers board game that me (Thiveyan J) and my friend (Matthew B) coded to test our Java skills.
It is designed for two-players to play against each other (with a vscomputer in development). Feel free to check this out and provide your feedback. Have fun!
# Game
Each player has 12 pieces that fit inside each of the boxes on the board. The pieces are placed on every other dark square and then staggered by rows.
Each Checkers player has different colored pieces. Here it is Black and white.
# Turns 
Each player takes their turn by moving a piece. Pieces are always moved diagonally in the forward direction (towards the opponent) to the next dark square.
# Capturing Pieces:
If there is one of the opponent's pieces next to a piece and an empty space on the other side, you jump your opponent and remove their piece. You can do multiple jumps if they are lined up in the forward direction. If you have a jump, you have no choice but to take it.
# King Piece:
The last row is called the king row. If you get a piece across the board to the opponent's king row, that piece becomes a king. King pieces can move in both directions, forward and backward. 
# Winning the Game 
You win the game when the opponent has no more pieces or can't move (even if he/she still has pieces). If neither player can move then it is a draw or a tie.
